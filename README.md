# DongHae API Dev Container

This project is designed to provide a container-based development environment for the ongoing development of the DongHae Frontend. It is implemented with Docker and Dev Container CLI, allowing you to easily set up your development environment and get started on coding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can use the DongHae Frontend Dev Container, you need to install the following:

- [Docker or Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Dev Container CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli)

## Usage

### Building the Docker Image

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ATG-AMS/dh-api-dev.git && cd dh-api-dev

### Pushing the Docker Image

Once you've made changes and want to push your Docker image to the GitHub Container Registry, follow these steps:

1. Tag your Docker image:

```bash
docker tag <IMAGE_ID> ghcr.io/atg-ams/dh-api-dev:<TAG>
```

2. Authenticate to the GitHub Container Registry using your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):
